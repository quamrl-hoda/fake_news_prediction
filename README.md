Fake News Prediction: Overview
This project focuses on building models to predict whether a news article is real or fake using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

1)Features:
i)Data Preprocessing:
   Text cleaning: Removing stop words, punctuation, and irrelevant characters.
   Tokenization and stemming.
   Converting text to lowercase for uniformity.

ii)Feature Extraction:
   Bag of Words (BoW): Representing text as word frequency vectors.
   TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Capturing important words.
iii)Word Embeddings: Using pre-trained models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or fastText.
iv)Machine Learning Models:
    Logistic Regression.

v)Evaluation Metrics:
      Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
vi)Datasets:
      Kaggle Fake News Dataset: Contains news articles labeled as real or fake.

vii)Project Workflow:
     collection and preprocessing.
     Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
     Feature extraction and vectorization.
     Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
     Model evaluation and comparison.
viii)Potential Applications:
    Social media content moderation.
    Fact-checking platforms.
    Media bias and credibility analysis.
ix)Future Directions:
   Enhancing models with domain-specific embeddings.
   Multi-lingual fake news detection.
   Addressing adversarial attacks and bias in predictions.
